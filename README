/* DESCRIPTION */
The purpose of this project is to implement equations dealing with the effects
of relativity on ships travelling near the speed of light.  The equations can 
be found on the Atomic Rocket page (www.projectrho.com/rocket/), under the 
"Slower Than Light" section.
(http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/slowerlight.php#id--Relativity)
I make no claims to the correctness of these equations - the author of the site
himself makes a similar disclaimer.
